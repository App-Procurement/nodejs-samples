## Errors

Service Api Requisition uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the ```2xx``` range indicate success. Codes in the ```4xx``` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the ```5xx``` range indicate an error with Stripe's servers (these are rare).

Some ```4xx``` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is declined) include an error code that briefly explains the error reported.

 # HTTPS STATUS CODE SUMMRY

Code   | Summary
------------- | -------------
200 - OK  | Everything worked as expected.
400 - Bad Request  | The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
401 - Unauthorized | No valid API key provided.
402 - Request Failed | The parameters were valid but the request failed.
403 - Forbidden | The API key doesn't have permissions to perform the request.
404 - Not Found | The requested resource doesn't exist.
409 - Conflict | The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key)
429 - Too Many Requests | Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors | Something went wrong on Stripe's end. (These are rare.)
